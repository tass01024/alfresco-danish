DANISH LANGUAGE PACK
Release @@edition@@ @@version@@

This release is targeted at the Alfresco @@edition@@ version. It may or may not
work with Alfresco Enterprise version and is an port from the Danish version.

To make this release available, time and effort has been donated by
Redpill Linpro AB, http://www.redpill-linpro.com

In this package you will find two install options, one quick install with jar
file, one with two amp-files plus supporting files.

It is recommended that you backup you system before proceeding and to test in
a test environment before installing into production system.

* InstallOption1 (preferred) *
1. Copy the file share_da_DK-@@version@@-@@edition@@.jar found in folder
InstallOption1 to tomcat/shared/lib. If that folder does not exist, you can 
create it.
2. Restart Alfresco, and you should have Danish available as a language option
for both Alfresco Share and Alfresco Explorer.

For Alfresco Explorer client the jar file includes configuration to make Danish
available. If you use your own web-client-config-custom.xml you may have to
follow step 6 under InstallOption2

* InstallOption2 *
You will need to install both files to get a complete translation.
Installation is a bit different for Alfresco repository and Share client, so
please follow instructions below.

1. Stop your Alfresco application server.
2. Drop the alfresco_da_DK-@@version@@-@@edition@@.amp into the amps subdirectory.
3. Create a subdirectory to you Alfresco install directory called amps-share
   (if it does not exist). Note the spelling of amps-share directory.
4. Drop the share_da_DK-@@version@@-@@edition@@.amp into the amps-share subdirectory.
5. Run the apply_amps.sh or apply_amps.bat file to install the Danish
   translation module. It will install for both Alfresco Explorer and Share.
6. Update shared/classes/alfresco/extension/web-client-config-custom.xml.

   <config evaluator="string-compare" condition="Languages" replace="true">
      <languages>
	<language locale="da_DK">Danish</language>         
	<language locale="en_US">English</language> 
      </languages>
   </config>

Note: This is a sample configuration, you may of course have more or less
languages in the file. You have to use the replace="true" directive in order
to replace Alfresco default configuration.

7. Start you Alfresco application server.

* Alfresco Share - select language *
For Alfresco Share client, it detects the language preferences set in the
options dialog for your browser. Consult the help file for your browser and
set [da] or [da_DK] as your topmost preferred language.

* Known issues *
SHARE
If your locale is non-english, ie you have in 
JAVA_OPTS -Duser.language=da -Duser.country=DK
you will be unable to display the standard default english user interface.
Workaround: Use -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US in JAVA_OPTS or if you 
need Danish for Alfresco repository, install Alfresco Share on separate Tomcat.
